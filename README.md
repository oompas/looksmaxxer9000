## Inspiration 💡

A few weeks ago, Ava stumbled upon an [interesting video](https://youtu.be/3M8ZxQiK4qo?si=9wvzmMxoS2aInDcQ) in her YouTube recommendations. It delved into how the meanings of words and phrases evolve – or even lose their original context – as they morph into viral memes in pop culture. For example, terms like "sigma," "pilled," and "maxxer" have taken on entirely new lives in online spaces, far removed from their origins in Incel communities 🤨

This sparked a memey deep-dive in our group chat into the subreddits and forums connected to Incel culture, where we inevitably landed on "looksmaxxing." We found it both absurd and hilarious... but it also got us thinking: what if we took a meme and pushed it to its technical limits? Graphic design _is_ our passion after all... ✨

## What it does 💞

The real question is what [_doesn't_](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/aeHgW4a5CJM) it do?!? 🎯
(I don't actually know what it does) but it'll make you look like 9000 bucks 😎

## How we built it ⚙️

We used key functionality from the cv2 library to build upon. None of what we did is supposed to be allowed... Anyways, we have like 30 images stacked together for the output. First, we built a face mesh comprised of landmark points to detect and map various facial features. The face mash detects the angle of the face, if the user's face is properly pointing towards and maintaining eye contact with the camera, and analyzes the distance away from the camera. Our graphic designer made a lot of cool graphics that provide arrow directions to center your face in the frame. Then, we used AI enhancement to improve and upscale images, so even those with "bad" cameras can looksmaxx! Guess you gotta check out our demo or download the app to try it out for yourself :p

We also made some cool math games on the face mesh to detect light vectors and analyze if the lighting conditions and its direction are optimal, so you can move either it or your camera around to looksmaxx even harder 😤

## Challenges we ran into ⏳

Literally everything. Again, none of what we did is supposed to be allowed... 😚

On the real, 3/4 of our laptops hated cuda and 1/4 of them still does 😬 (thou shalt not be named)

## Accomplishments that we're proud of 💥

Realizing the means to achieve the looksmaxxing goals of our dreams 🥰

## What we learned 😎

Learned a lot about how to take good photos and how to interface with cameras... we're like cv2 experts at this point 😀

## What's next for LooksMaxxer9000 😈
People using our app to take their looksmaxxing to the max 🗣️

Lastly, sorry Helena for our horrendous use of your cute kawaii illustrations 🥺
